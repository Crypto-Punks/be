According to the team, Flash Staking periods feature a block discovery rate that is 6x the normal PoS rate, benefiting all users with faster transaction times. The most notable platform built on the PINK network is Donate4Life, whose main goal is helping people in need by facilitating fundraising for charities and individuals via Pinkcoin's staking reward sharing platform.",

After a SHA256 proof-of-work phase, Bean Cash became a pure PoS currency; the block reward is fixed at 1000 Beans plus any transaction fees attached to the transactions included.  This was the first instance of this version of PoS, which the Bean Cash community calls \"Proof of Bean\" (PoB).  Bean Cash' target block time is one minute, with a maximum block size of 20MB.  It is projected to reach its maximum supply of 50 billion beans in 2111.\r\n\r\nThe team consists of volunteers from around the world who donate time and resources to the project.  Team Bean is the greater Bean Cash community, consisting of anyone who has an interest in the technology.  Anyone who can prove they hold 1% or more of the current outstanding Bean Cash may join Bean Core and have a vote in the direction Bean Cash development takes.  The Executive Board consists of 3 Bean Core members who hold 5% or more of the current outstanding Bean Cash.  They rule by consensus.  If a vote is not unanimous, it does not pass.  The Board may overrule suggestions coming from Bean Core or put forward its own suggestions.  The Board can, likewise, be overruled by a 2/3 super-majority of Bean Core.",

Waves Platform describes itself as an open network for Web 3.0 applications and custom decentralized solutions, with a range of purpose-designed tools for making the process of developing and running dApps easy and accessible. Launched in 2016, Waves has since released several blockchain-based solutions. Waves’ technology is designed to address the needs of developers and companies that want to leverage the properties of blockchain systems – including their security, auditability, verifiability and the trustless execution of transactions and business logic.\r\n\r\nWaves Platform claims to provide everything required to support the backend of Web 3.0 services. In 2017, Waves launched its mainnet with LPoS, decentralized exchange DEX, and later the Waves-NG protocol. In 2018, the Waves development team delivered the first implementation of smart contracts. This was followed by the release of the RIDE programming language in 2019, Strightforward, Predictible and Failproof language for programming logic. In June 2019 the mainnet of Waves Enterprise, a global private blockchain solution, was launched. All of this is complemented with a broad infrastructure: an IDE for sandbox development, tools, SDKs, libraries, frameworks, and protocols for convenient and easy integrations.\r\n\r\nWaves Platform consists of three core layers:\r\n\r\nProtocol layer: LPoS, Waves-NG, fixed fees, easy mining start, various transactions models\r\n\r\nInfrastructure layer: Keeper for private key management, IDE for sandbox development, smart-contracts programming language RIDE and other tools for dApp development, API’s, libraries, tools, and frameworks.\r\n\r\nApplication layer: basic core open-source apps (decentralized exchange, mobile apps, and voting) and various dApps running on the network.",

As of March 2019, the LBRY network reportedly has over 800K pieces of content published such as movies, videos, images, games, documents. \r\n\r\nThis reportedly includes content from YouTubers (https://lbry.com/youtubers) a movie studio publishing films like Howl (https://open.lbry.com/howl), starring James Franco, and 'It's a Disaster' ( https://open.lbry.com/itsadisaster), starring David Cross. LBRY utilizes a rewards program to incentivize app users and publishers by allowing them to earn LBC for completing tasks within the apps, both as new users and on a recurring basis (i.e. watching weekly featured content). \r\n\r\nThe LBRY blockchain aims to provide a global namespace and database of content available on the network including searchable content metadata, signed publisher identities, rights, and access rules. Included in the metadata is a pointer to a decentralized data network like BitTorrent.

The team claims that variable block-times allow Verium to scale automatically while enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to ensure high levels of network security at any level of mining throughput. By linking the binary chain and Verium’s auxiliary mining protocol (AuxPOW), Verium will also process VeriCoin blocks. This protocol reportedly speeds up VeriCoin’s block-time to less than 30 seconds. These technologies reportedly enable VeriCoin’s network to provide an efficient and scalable system for consumer transactions. \r\n\r\nThe Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium). It aims to secure and accelerate transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time) into a blockchain system. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast, and scalable digital transactions.",

Designed to solve peer to peer transfer of value, Nano aims to revolutionize the world economy through an ultrafast and fee-less network that is open and accessible to everyone. \r\n\r\nNano is reportedly able to offer fast and feeless transactions due to the Block Lattice - a data structure in which all accounts each have their own blockchain, rather than competing with others on a central chain. Consensus is generated through representative voting, where accounts can freely choose their representative at any time with an update of their account chain, thereby providing more control for users to decide who validates transactions.\r\n\r\nEach component of the protocol was created with the long term goals of decentralization and accessibility in mind. By creating a system where representatives are not paid to operate, the incentive to participate in the network is shifted to indirect, operational cost savings. The team claims that this change in incentive model is more efficient and removes one of the factors driving centralization in other systems because participants are not encouraged to interact beyond their direct needs and supporting the network, and thus economies of scale become less critical.",

Each node subscribes to a select number of other network nodes, and the density of a node’s network of subscribers determines its influence on the network.\r\n\r\nSkywire, the flagship application of Skycoin, aims to decentralize the internet at the hardware level. Skywire's objectives extend beyond providing decentralized bandwidth - it also aims to offer storage and computation.",

Computing power providers are called ‘iExec Workers’. As workers, users can connect their machines and be rewarded in RLC tokens for contributing resources to the network. Application providers can monetize their applications and algorithms. Data providers who own valuable datasets can make them available for use by applications through iExec. The iExec consensus protocol ‘PoCo’ (Proof of Contribution) provides consensus over off-chain computing and can also be used to integrate decentralized oracles with iExec.\r\n\t\r\niExec believes that its strength lies in trusted off-chain computing. Its representative heads the ‘Trusted Compute Working’ group within the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. It has partnered with Intel to release a 'trusted compute' solution for blockchain (TEE using Intel SGX).  Other iExec collaborators include Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Genesis Cloud, EDF electrical utility company, EEA, and Ubisoft. iExec was one of the contributors to the Trusted Compute Framework (Hyperledger Avalon) alongside Microsoft, Intel, ConsenSys, Envision, PegaSys, and Kaleido. \r\n\r\niExec is working with various organizations and consortiums with the goal of providing scalable, secure and easy access to the services, datasets, and computing resources.",

Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds. Should users desire access to off-chain data, they can submit a requesting contract to ChainLink’s network. These contracts will match the requesting contract with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The aggregating contract gathers data of the selected oracles to find the most accurate result.",

The identities of the node operators are currently private in order to maintain operational security, but these are reportedly independent, reputable digital service providers, with a history of reliable availability and maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe distribution and algorithmic logic of the Kin Rewards Engine is overseen by the Kin Foundation, a non-profit organization based out of Ontario, Canada. Undistributed Kin is held in an institutional-grade treasury that is controlled via a series of vesting periods, inflation guidelines, and fiduciary custody controls that ensure the safe transfer and proper use of funds. Anti-spam and anti-fraud assurances are also provided as a service until such time that the distribution of Kin can be fully automated with those additional safeguards in place. No more than 10 trillion Kin will ever exist by the end of the distribution period, the large supply meant to allow mass adoption by users around the world while still transacting in whole-number denominations, as opposed to decimal places.",

    "description": "Founded in early 2017, Upfiring was established to create an alternative to traditional P2P file-sharing protocols by incentivizing seeders through the use of a tokenized file-sharing economy. Traditional P2P file-sharing and networks offer no incentives for seeders and as a result, low file availability and slow downloading speeds are frequent issues. By incentivizing seeding, Upfiring aims to create a healthier file-sharing network that allows content creators and seeders to be rewarded directly for sharing content without any third-party intermediaries. \r\n\r\nUpfiring’s first usable dapp prototype launched on mainnet in December 2018, with their full application launching on 5 February 2019. The dapp is cross-platform - available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The application allows users to generate encrypted .ufr files with embedded price data and seed them on the Upfiring network. Users earn UFR tokens in exchange for seeding and keeping files online. Seeder smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum network mediate the movement of files across the network, maintain seeder UFR balances and allow for the decryption of files when warranted.\r\n\r\nUpfiring targets content-creators by allowing them to promote their content directly to users without relying on any third-party intermediaries. UFR tokens are used within the dapp to unlock encrypted content. The dapp can be downloaded from https://www.upfiring.com, and the corresponding documentation can be found at [https://www.upfiring.com/documentation.html](https://www.upfiring.com/documentation.html)",

It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption. Furthermore, API integration will streamline implementation.\r\n\r\nAppCoins integrates app stores, users, developers, advertisers, and OEMs. This system is app store agnostic, existing across different mobile platforms (Android & iOS). The different app stores act as oracles of the smart contracts, which are associated with each of the platform’s core transactions. This system creates a trust layer for the economy, obviating the need for intermediaries. AppCoins aims to become the universal language of the app economy.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also includes a so-called Proof-of-Attention system. Users, app stores, and OEMs receive tokens through the Proof-of Attention concept as a reward. Developers that want to advertise their apps can be sure that the user has installed and used it. The users reinvest their tokens via inapp purchases and this would theoretically create a virtuous loop that boosts the AppCoins economic growth.\r\n\r\n- Link to the Source Code: https://github.com/AppStoreFoundation  \r\n- Chat: https://t.me/appcoinsofficial  \r\n- Announcement: https://medium.com/@appcoins \r\n- Source: Official website: https://appcoins.io",

Sharding is analogous to the concept of 'divide and conquer', where transactions are divided into smaller groups for miners to perform parallel transactional verification. The upshot of this is the ability to reach consensus more quickly, which would increase the number of transactions in a given period. According to the white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion. ",

This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits.

The PCHAIN mainnet was launched on 30 Mar 2019. \r\n\r\nPCHAIN was founded by a team that has reportedly published 100 IEEE ACM papers and international patents. PCHAIN claims to have been granted 6 patents. As of 1 Apr 2019, the PCHAIN team is based in Singapore, Shanghai, State of Qatar & Silicon Valley. It has 70K+ followers in Bihu (a Chinese social platform ) and 60K+ followers in Telegram from nearly one hundred countries.\r\n\r\nPCHAIN has reportedly received strategic investments from global funds such as FBG, Plug&Play, LD Capital, JRR, Genesis, Bixin and LinkVC,etc. PCHAIN also received the Silicon Valley’s“Most Promising Blockchain Foundation Platform 2018”award and was hailed as the“Best Blockchain Platform in 2018” by Bitcoinist. PCHAIN has board collaboration with over 30 blockchain partners such as North America Blockchain Association, IEEE, CFLP, etc.\r\n\r\nKey features include:\r\n\r\n- Native EVM multichain that enables the interoperability of child chain and main chain. It can reportedly support 256+ child chains in testnet 1.0 with 1064 nodes globally. The project claims that the network supports 126K TPS and can be scaled linearly as the number of child chains increases.\r\n- Patented PDBFT algorithm that combines VRF+BLS+BFT is reportedly able to support more nodes than traditional PBFT algorithms.\r\n- Oracle mechanism based on the knowledge graph reportedly makes it easier to encapsulate smart contracts - W3C compliant smart data addresses the issue of non-intelligence in smart contracts\r\n- Safe Delegation and Blind Bidding that reportedly enables a fair and secure validator election during epoch switches.\r\n- Cross-chain capability. The smart contracts of PCHAIN can purportedly be invoked with other non-native tokens (BCH, ERC20) by using the provided toolkit.",

    "description": "Launched in Jun 2018 and based on the Cryptonote foundations of Monero, Ryo is headed by fireice_uk and psychocrypt, a duo with development work on opensource mining software proof of work algorithms. \r\n\r\nThe team claims that the Ryo blockchain does not have the 0-mixin Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) that characterize older Cryptonote chains because Ryo has ring sizes of 25. These settings reportedly reduce the chances of being identified and traced by blockchain statistical analysis. The Ryo developers implemented a uniform transaction ID system that hides the use of payment IDs because all transactions now have a uniform ID that is retrofitted with the old payment ID system. The team claims that Ryo is the first amongst various Cryptonote currencies to implement this feature, which addresses the metadata leak that reportedly affects Cryptonote coins with payment IDs. \r\n\r\nRyo aims to function as a store of value that is suitable for highly confidential transactions. The core mission of the project is to deliver a currency with true fungibility. This means that each coin is equal and interchangeable; the team claims that it is highly unlikely that any coin can ever by blacklisted due to previous transactions.",
